Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing and preparing the application to be usable in different locales around the world. Localization (l10n) is the process of building versions of your app for different locales, including extracting text for translation into different languages, and formatting data for particular locales.

A locale identifies a region (such as a country) in which people speak a particular language or language variant. The locale determines the formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, and currencies as well as measurement units and the translated names for time zones, languages, and countries.
